UK organic farming standards and regenerative agriculture practices via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Organic certification, conversion process, permitted inputs, cover crop guidance, biodiversity net gain, and soil health indicators -- all from your AI assistant.

Part of [Ansvar Open Agriculture](https://ansvar.eu/open-agriculture).

## Why This Exists

Farmers converting to organic need quick access to certification requirements (Soil Association, OF&G), permitted input lists, conversion timelines, cover crop data, and soil health targets. This information is scattered across regulation text, certification body PDFs, and research publications. This MCP server puts it all in one place, searchable by AI assistants.

## Quick Start

### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "uk-organic-regen": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@ansvar/uk-organic-regen-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add uk-organic-regen npx @ansvar/uk-organic-regen-mcp
```

### Streamable HTTP (remote)

```
https://mcp.ansvar.eu/uk-organic-regen/mcp
```

### Docker (self-hosted)

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/ansvar-systems/uk-organic-regen-mcp:latest
```

### npm (stdio)

```bash
npx @ansvar/uk-organic-regen-mcp
```

## Example Queries

Ask your AI assistant:

- "What are the Soil Association standards for organic arable farming?"
- "How long does organic conversion take for cattle?"
- "What cover crops fix the most nitrogen before spring cereals?"
- "What's the BNG unit value of creating a wildflower meadow?"
- "What inputs are permitted for organic plant protection?"
- "What soil health indicators should I measure and what are the targets?"
- "What is the copper limit for organic farming?"
